When the validation process is complete, you will receive a message to let you know that either your app or add-in is approved, or you need to make changes and resubmit it. You can also follow these steps to check the approval status in the Seller Dashboard:
  
    
    

1. Sign in to the  [Seller Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248605).
    
  
2. On the **manage** tab, your app or add-in status appears under the app or add-in name.

    - If the status is **pending approval**, your app or add-in is still being verified. When it is in this state, you can't update or resubmit it.
    
    
    - If the status is **approved**, your app or add-in is approved to be listed in the appropriate marketplaces.
    
    > NOTE After your app or add-in is approved in the Seller Dashboard, there might be a delay before it is published in a store. After approval, an app or add-in typically appears in the store within 24 hours. 
    
    - If the status is **changes requested**, your app or add-in needs changes in order to be approved. Choose the app or add-in, and then on the summary page, choose **View the add-in report** for details about the required changes.
    
  
If you make changes to an approved app or add-in, it must go through the approval process again.
