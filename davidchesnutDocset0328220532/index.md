2. On the **manage** tab, your app or add-in status appears under the app or add-in name.
    
  - If the status is **pending approval**, your app or add-in is still being verified. When it is in this state, you can't update or resubmit it.
  
  
  - If the status is **approved**, your app or add-in is approved to be listed in the appropriate marketplaces.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > After your app or add-in is approved in the Seller Dashboard, there might be a delay before it is published in a store. After approval, an app or add-in typically appears in the store within 24 hours. 
  
  - If the status is **changes requested**, your app or add-in needs changes in order to be approved. Choose the app or add-in, and then on the summary page, choose **View the add-in report** for details about the required changes.
